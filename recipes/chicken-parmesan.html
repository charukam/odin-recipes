    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in
      Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem
      fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in
      your own kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions of Chicken
      Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much
      sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and
      cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the
      chicken with sauce and cheese. The key to great non-soggy chicken
      Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit
      of sauce on top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot
      of sauce on your chicken Parmesan, that's fine, you can always serve extra
      sauce on the side. I also use some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe!
      Curiously, most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here,
      I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone
      and real Parmesan.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 skinless, bones chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
      <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
      <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
      <li>1/2 cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      <li>1/2 cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated provolone cheese</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable
        freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken
        with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or
        strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides
      </li>
      <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the
        bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each
        breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it
        begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2
        minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons
        tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella
        cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan
        over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and
        chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
        165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
